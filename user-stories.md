Bob is a professor at the university in Delft specializing in algorithmics. Next to his work in this field he also teaches students the fundamentals, theory and science behind algorithms. For this reason he often needs to write simple programs to demonstrate these algorithms in class. However he found that often there is confusion when explaining code to his students as the code and the execution are disjoint. For this reason he wants to be able to go through his code in a step by step manner and display the effects of each step. 

* An algorithms teacher wants to visualize somme algorithms for his students
* A student wants step through a visualization of an algorithm he/she doesn't understand
* A developer wants to show his fellow developers quickly how his code solves a problem 
* A developer wants to show how a certain data structure works
* A developer wants to gain insight in a specific part an algorithm 
* A developer wants to add some visualizations to someone elses code to understand it better
