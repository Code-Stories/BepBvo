Bob 
Bob is a professor at the university in Delft specializing in algorithmics. Next to his work in this field he also teaches students the fundamentals, theory and science behind algorithms. For this reason he often needs to write simple programs to demonstrate these algorithms in class. However he found that often there is confusion when explaining code to his students as the code and the execution are disjoint. For this reason he wants to be able to go through his code in a step by step manner and display the effects of each step. 

* An algorithms teacher wants to visualize some algorithms for his students so that it is easier to explain
* A student wants step through a visualization of an algorithm so that he understands it better
* A developer wants to show his fellow developers quickly how his code solves a problem in the interrest of saving time
* A developer wants to display a certain data structure so that he can show this to his coworkers. 
* A developer wants to gain insight in a specific part an algorithm 
* A developer wants to add some visualizations to someone elses code to understand it better



Bob is a Computer science teacher and wants to teach his students about BubbleSort
He had a thought on how this could be made more intuitivly for his students if they can see the code in action 
by swapping bars in a bar graph. 
He loads his bubblesort code into the program. 
He adds code to display the original array 
He adds code at the swap elements to swap the location of the visual elements in the canvas
He shows his students the execution. 


Alice has written a js interpreter. She wants people to quickly see how it works. 
She codes up a visual display for a stack, a venndiagram to represent the variables and their scope.
At every type of step , the variable used are highlighted and moved to represent the step. 



Charlie wants to show his students how to do matrix multiplication. 
He takes a simple double nested loop code and loads this into our program.
He codes the matricis to be displayed one left , the other on top and an empty matrix in the middle. 
At the multiplication step two arrows from the original matricies point to the empty spot.
