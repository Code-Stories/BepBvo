#Code editor

Requirements:
* Easy to use
* Easy to edit
* Lightweight
* Simple (not to full featured)
* Open source

List of Options:
* Ace: http://ace.c9.io/
* Code Mirror: http://codemirror.net
* ICE Coder: https://icecoder.net/
* Codiad: http://codiad.com/

These options are the commonly used code editors for the web. Ace and Code mirror are the most simple with only having the minimal most common features you would expect in a code editor like syntax highlighting, automatic indent and outdent and code folding. On top of that they allow to be embedded into html document, which gives more freedom for how the document is structured. 

Pros:

Cons: 

The two later options, ICE Coder and Codiad are not meant for embedding but rather are to be adjusted to fit our needs. They are full web based IDEs and among other things feature support for a multitude of languages, can be used online or locally, has its own file manager on top of all the common features the previous two code editors have.

Pros:

Cons:

The question now is, which of these two approaches is optimal for use in our solution.
