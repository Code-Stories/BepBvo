#Existing solutions

To research some of the existing solutions we've looked at some ways to generate interactive documentation.

##[code-guide](http://www.natpryce.com/software/code-guide/example/selector-button-blink.html)

Code guide is a solution to generate interactive documentation from python files. It works by writing a string of documentation and linking it to one or more lines of code. When the interactive documentation is started, the lines of code for which documentation is available are highlighted in sequence and it's documentation is shown in a text bubble.

##[Python  Tutor](http://www.pythontutor.com/)
Python tutor is a tool that explains the execution of a python script. It does ths by stepping through the code like a debugger and showing the state of the program on the right. It shows fairly low level animations with no possibility to be extended.
